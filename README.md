# Springboard.com repository for Intermediate Data Science using Python

This is a repository for Intermediate Data Science using Python course that started for me on July 9th, 2018. This will be a place where I will put all my code for different exercises during the course.

This will also be the place for putting the code for my Capstone project which needs to be completed as part of ciricullum of Intermediate Data Science course.
